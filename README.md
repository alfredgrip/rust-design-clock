# A simple Rust GUI app built with GTK4
The usage of this app is very limited, but it can display the current time (in Swedish) in a nice fashion.

Heavily inspired by the designer clock [QLOCKTWO](https://qlocktwo.com/).

## To build and run
Simply build with `cargo` and run it as you prefer.

There might be some dependencies, but which ones I do not know.
